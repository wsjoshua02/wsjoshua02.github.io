        <p>Howdy! My name is Joshua Yan.</strong></p>
        <p>Iâ€™m a senior at Texas A&M University, planning on graduating in Spring of 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering.</p>
        <p>I have a strong background in STEM via school coursework in fields such as mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering, as well as through my Summer 2023 internship at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where I learned to apply my skills and how to work in a high level professional environment.</p>
        <p>Outside of school and work:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I've been to 14 countries, and enjoy traveling and experiencing the world.</li>

            <li>I like to dance! I'm the president of FUSD, a street dance club at Texas A&M. We host community dance events such as workshops and dance battles, perform for various audiences, and travel to compete at events around Texas. Check out one of my highlight reels below!</li>

            <li>I'm a fan of the Dallas Mavericks, and I've been to many games; witnessing a Dirk Nowitzki game winner in person was a core memory of mine.</li>
