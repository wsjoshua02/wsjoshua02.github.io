        <p>Howdy! My name is Joshua Yan.</strong></p>
        <p>Iâ€™m a senior at Texas A&M University, planning on graduating in Spring of 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering.</p>
        <p>I have a strong background in STEM via school coursework in fields such as mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering, as well as through my Summer 2023 internship at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where I learned to apply my skills and how to work in a high level professional environment.</p>
        <p>Here are some fun facts about me:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I've been to 14 countries.</li>

            <li>I like to dance! I started in high school and currently am an officer for a breakdancing and hip hop club at A&M, and recently have started entering competitions around Texas. Check out my demo reel below!</li>

            <li>I'm a fan of the Dallas Mavericks, and I've been to many games; witnessing a Dirk Nowitzki game winner in person was a core memory of mine.</li>
            <li>I have a Shiba-Inu Chihuaha mix named Trooper.</li>
            <li>I love trying new foods; one of my favorite parts of my Chinese heritage is the cuisine, and I love seeing what other cultures have to offer. I also do my best to hone my skills in the kitchen.</li>
