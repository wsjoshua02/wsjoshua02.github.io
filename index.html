    <p>Hi! My name is Josh Yan, and I'm an engineer based in the DFW Area.
      I'm an ASIC Design Verification Engineer at HPE, and a 2024 Computer Engineering graduate 
      of Texas A&M University. My experience includes Design Verification for ASIC development 
      in my previous summer internship using SystemVerilog and UVM, as well as coursework in 
      C++, Verilog, circuit design and implementation, and mathematics from calculus to linear algebra.
    </p>
    <p>Outside of work:</p>
    <ol class="center">
      <li>I've been to 14 countries, and enjoy traveling and experiencing the world.</li>
      <br>
      <li>I like to dance! I was the president of a freestyle street dance club at my time at A&M. Nowadays I enjoy practicing
        and honing my skills, and even occasionally compete in battles and events. Just don't ask me about Raygun!</li>
      <br>
      <li>I'm a fan of the Dallas Mavericks, and I've been to many games; witnessing a Dirk Nowitzki game winner in person was a core memory of mine.</li>
      <br>
      <li>I have a Shiba-Inu Chihuaha mix named Trooper.</li>
      <br>
      <li>I love trying new foods and also enjoy freestyling and honing my skills in the kitchen almost just as much as on the dance floor!</li>

    <p>Here are a few projects I've worked on over the years.</p>

    <p><strong>Smart Kitchen Scale</strong></p>
    <figure  style="text-align:center;">

        <figcaption>An image of our system hardware.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <ul>
        <li>Project for CSCE 483 Computer Systems Design/Senior Capstone</li>
        <li>With a team of 6, developed a Smart Kitchen Scale, capable of using machine learning and computer vision to identify food names and extract digits from a 7 segment display, and then use these labels to return detailed nutritional information in a connected mobile app</li>
        <li>Helped develop and test a convolutional neural network via TensorFlow and MobileNetV2 to identify 30 selected fruits and vegetables</li>
        <li>Used OpenCV to extract numbers from a camera image and read the digits, performing image manipulation such as Gaussian blurring and greyscaling</li>
        <li>Used GPIO to read in user input, allowing users to take pictures with the camera and capture image data</li>
        <li>Worked with my team to create extensive documentation and to represent the TAMU engineering department</li>
        <li>Presented our work in front of fellow students, faculty, and industry professionals from Walmart and Visa</li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w3jIZSDz5X47Fbv5KSUmGl1dPjpx3ks9?usp=sharing"><p><u>System Documentation and Demo Here</u></p></a></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Transaction Translation Sequence</strong></p>

        <figcaption>HPE's Slingshot Interconnect, which I helped verify and test.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <ul>
        <li>Assignment for my Design Verification internship at HPE.</li>
        <li>Translated data transactions between the Outbound Transfer Engine (OXE) and the Inbound Transfer Engine (IXE) interfaces in the Cassini-3 Network Interface Controller, overriding the base sequence.</li>
        <li>Extracted data from a data message sent by the OXE, and used said data to populate and randomize an intermediate request frame object, handling different message types.
        </li>
        <li>Used values sourced from the request frame to randomize and populate a data request object, which was subsequently  sent to the IXE.</li>
        <li>I used SystemVerilog to write the sequence functions, runSim and Linux to test and debug, Launch for simulation, and Perforce for version control and to access documentation.</li>
        <li>Worked extensively with my fellow DV team to update my progress, learn the HPE code base, and debug and test my sequence.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Restaurant Online Point of Sale System</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Project for my CSCE 331 Software Engineering Class</li>
        <li>With my team, created a point of sale system website that allowed users to order food at a fictional restaurant while also updating a restaurant database that stored information pertaining to the restaurant, such as employee information, inventory, menus, sales, and sales trends.</li>
        <li>We used SQL to create a database, HTML and Bootstrap for the front end design, LightSail to host our website,  Python for randomizing and populating the database, and JavaScript with PHP for the back end functionality.</li>
        <li>Worked professionally with my team members using the Agile Development Methodology, holding scrum meetings, peer reviews, and user feedback sessions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Connect Four Opponent</strong></p>

    </figure>
    <ul>
        <li>Project for my CSCE 462 Microcomputer Systems Class</li>
        <li>With my partner, created a physical Connect Four game system with a Raspberry Pi 3 with both a traditional 2 player game mode and an automated single player game mode.        </li>
        <li>We used Python to implement the automated game algorithm, based on Victor Allis’s thesis and the MinMax algorithm, and communicated with the Raspberry Pi using event listeners and various packages that controlled a light matrix representing the game board, and push buttons to send inputs.</li>
        <li>Created extensive documentation on the project, such as a report and presentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Dance Events</strong></p>

        <figcaption>Promotional posters I designed for some of the freestyle street dance competitions I organized.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <ul>
        <li>With my club FUSD, I organized and hosted multiple dance events such as dance battle competitions and workshops, bringing together freestyle dancers from our club, other organizations on campus, and from the wider Texas freestyle dance community.</li>
        <li>Worked with my team to discuss and decide on key logistics, such as event vision, dates, guests to invite and contact, itinerary, format, and budget</li>
        <li>Reached out to and negotiated with outside talent, such as judges, workshop teachers, and DJs</li>
        <li>Designed and created promotional materials and promoted events via social media</li>
        <li>Kept the event running smoothly by MCing, serving as a point of contact with guests, and working with all attendees to ensure a positive experience</li>
